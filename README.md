# Pokedex in JavaScript

This is a project from DIO's JavaScript Developer training. The goal was to add functionality to an already-made project, but I decided to create my own version of the project using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

# Demonstration

## How to use

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. The pokedex will be displayed with a list of all available pokemons.

## Functionalities
